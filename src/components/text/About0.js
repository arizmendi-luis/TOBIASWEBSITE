export const text ="The Tethered Observatory for Balloon Based Imaging and Atmospheric Sampling aka TOBIAS is a project by Stanford's SSI Balloons Team's TOBIAS team. The project aimed to create a bases on which to build off of from NASA’s original TOBIAS design (figure 1) " + 
"This design’s task was to take images of Venus’s surface. In order to circumnavigate the harsh temperatures and chemicals present in Venus’ atmosphere, the design aimed to take advantage of a protective cloud layer over Venus surface which would provide a probe more generous conditions. To do this the design incorporated the use of a high altitude balloon that would have a tow body attached to it by a long (approximately 1km) retractable tether that would have communication and powered wires flowing through it. The tow body would have all the necessary data capturing devices (camera, IMU, ect.) on board to capture images and other data of Venus. The Stanford team’s contribution so far has been prototyping and iterating through possible tow body designs."
