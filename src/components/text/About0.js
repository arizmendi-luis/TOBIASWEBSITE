Stanford's SSI Balloons Team has worked on the project since January 2022, attempting to design a stable prototype based on NASA JPL’s design (Bottom or Left Image) This design’s task was to take images of Venus’s surface. In order to survive the harsh temperatures and chemicals present in the lower layers of the Venusian atmosphere, the design aimed to take advantage of the more habitable conditions above the cloud layer of Venus. To do this, the design incorporated the use of a high altitude balloon connected to a tow body, a multi-kilometer retractable tether, housing communication and power lines. The towbody would have all the necessary data capturing devices (camera, IMU.) on board to capture images and other data of Venus. The Stanford team has been prototyping and iterating possible towbody designs.";
